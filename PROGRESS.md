# PROGRESS

Session continuity only — what a fresh session needs to pick up where this one
stopped. **Not a record of completed work:** that lives in the Jira ticket, and
durable environment lessons live in the project memories. Prune it when a ticket
closes.

On resume: read this, then `git status` and `git log --oneline -5`.

## Current: nothing in flight

**AEH-240 and AEH-244 are both closed, merged and pushed.** Master is at
`d478808` on both remotes (github and origin/bitbucket). AEH-240 was stacked on
the unmerged AEH-244 branch, so landing it landed both — hence the merge commit
rather than a fast-forward. The implementation records are in the two tickets,
not here.

One thing was never exercised and is worth knowing: no e2e spec covers the
custodian or the deadline. See AEH-282 below.

## Databases

    local docker  ai_estimation        24 migrations
    local docker  ai_estimation_test   24 migrations
    Neon test     (ep-wild-heart)      24 migrations
    Neon dev/main (ep-polished-credit) 24 migrations

⚠️ Local docker `ai_estimation` has **demo deadlines** set on its six most recent
estimates (one overdue, one due today, one in two days, one in nine, two
undated) and a custodian on alternate rows. Set by hand on 2026-08-31 to see the
dashboard states; harmless, but they are not real data.

⚠️ Still true from AEH-259: seed Neon dev/main with targeted scripts only, never
`pnpm db:seed`. It carries hand-tuned prompts at v3 and v4 whose text exists
nowhere in the repo, and the bootstrap seed would revert all ten to their
two-sentence v1 bodies. On 2026-08-31 that database was wiped by a `migrate
diff` shadow-database mistake and restored from a four-hour-old backup — the
restore proved the point, since those prompt bodies are ~5000 characters each
and no other database in the project has anything resembling them. The lesson
lives in the `prisma-shadow-db-wiped-neon` memory.

## Related tickets

**AEH-237** — multi-level approval, and now genuinely unblocked: an estimate
carries a named person who is not merely its creator, on master.

**AEH-282** — the e2e suite. Open, and the reason AEH-240 shipped with unit
tests only. Two specs are worth writing when it is healthy: setting a deadline
clears the reminder rows, and the dashboard leads with what is overdue.

## Traps worth keeping

- A schema split turns one atomic row insert into N writes. Wrap every
  multi-table write in a `$transaction` — `setDueAt` does, because a moved
  deadline that kept its old reminder rows would silence every nudge for the
  new date.
- `new Date('2026-02-31')` does not fail. It quietly means 3 March, so a date
  parsed from a form has to be round-tripped against its own string.
- Deleting a "why" comment deletes the reason a guard exists.
- `pkill -f 'next dev'` inside a compound bash command matches the shell running
  it and kills the command before it starts — a bare exit 144. Kill by PID or
  process group instead. (Already in [[local-dev-env-traps]]; hit again anyway.)
